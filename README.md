# Da·ta Sci·ence Port·fo·li·o

```
Hello, World!
I'm Sabirin, a data science and analytics enthusiast who aims to apply my knowledge to real-world
situations. I've recently completed the Data Science: Machine Learning Specialization program at
Rakamin Academy, where I gained a thorough understanding of end-to-end data science processes.

This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, which serve as a demonstration
of my skills and experience in this field. These projects showcase my abilities in gathering,
processing, and analyzing large datasets, as well as my expertise in producing insightful
visualizations.
