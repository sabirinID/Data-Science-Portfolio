Hello, World!
I'm Sabirin, a data science and analytics enthusiast who aims to apply my knowledge to real-world situations.
I have recently completed the Data Science: Machine Learning Specialization program at Rakamin Academy, where
I gained a thorough understanding of end-to-end data science processes.

This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, which serve as a demonstration of my
skills and experience in this field. These projects showcase my abilities in gathering, processing, and
analyzing large datasets, as well as my expertise in producing insightful visualizations.
